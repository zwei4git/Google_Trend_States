## Google trend index explaination

### https://www.seobility.net/en/wiki/Google_Trends 
### Under Interest by region section:
"For the interest by region view, the number of search queries for a term  within a specific region is determined relative to the total volume of all 
search queries within the region (over a certain time period). The region with the highest relative volume then receives a score of 100 and all 
other countries are scaled down accordingly."
### Therefore no need for population adjustment

## Tools: google trend API (gtrendsR package), gganimate
